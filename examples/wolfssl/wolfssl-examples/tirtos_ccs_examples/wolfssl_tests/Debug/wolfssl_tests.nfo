		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern int main() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	xdc_runtime_System_printf__E() (1 times)
	ti_sysbios_BIOS_start__E() (1 times)
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_create() (1 times)
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params_init() (1 times)

extern void testwolfcrypt() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 11 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	ti_sysbios_BIOS_exit__E() (1 times)
	wolfcrypt_test() (1 times)
	xdc_runtime_System_flush__E() (1 times)
	xdc_runtime_System_printf__E() (2 times)

static void ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params_init() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 10 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params__init__S() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	main()
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params_init()
	testwolfcrypt()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params_init()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_Params__init__S()
	xdc_runtime_System_flush__E()
	wolfcrypt_test()
	ti_sysbios_BIOS_exit__E()
	ti_sysbios_knl_Task_create()
	ti_sysbios_BIOS_start__E()
	xdc_runtime_System_printf__E()
