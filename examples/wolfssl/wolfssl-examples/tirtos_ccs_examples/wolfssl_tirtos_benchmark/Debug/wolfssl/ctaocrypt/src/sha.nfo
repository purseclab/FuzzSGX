Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void ByteReverseWords() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned byteCount :  byteCount%44u == 20u;  byteCount <= 64u;  byteCount >= 20u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static unsigned rotlFixed() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned y :        y <= 30u;  y >= 1u;
Inlineable function will be suppressed: rotlFixed()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: min()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: ByteReverseWord32()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: AddLength()
Inlineable function will be suppressed: ByteReverseWords()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	memset()
	memcpy()
