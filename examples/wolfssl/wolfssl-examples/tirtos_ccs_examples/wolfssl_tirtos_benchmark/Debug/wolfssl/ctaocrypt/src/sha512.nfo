Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static unsigned long long rotrFixed64() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned long long y :  y <= 61uLL;  y >= 1uLL;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static void ByteReverseWords64() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned byteCount :  byteCount%16u == 0u;  byteCount <= 128u;  byteCount >= 64u;

Function rotlFixed() will be specialized on these parameters:
	[2] y == 16u;

Results of interprocedural value propagation:

   static unsigned rotlFixed() has these parameter attributes:
      unsigned y :        y == 16u;
