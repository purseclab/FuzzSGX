# PKCS7/CMS Examples

This directory contains example applications that demonstrate usage of the
wolfCrypt PKCS#7/CMS API, included in the [wolfSSL embedded SSL/TLS library](https://www.wolfssl.com).
It includes examples of several different content types (EncryptedData,
SignedData, EnvelopedData, CompressedData), and demonstrates both
signing/encrypting and verifying/decrypting operations.

## Building

### Build and Install wolfSSL

```
$ ./configure --enable-pkcs7
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Note, some examples require "--with-libz" and "--enable-pwdbased". To build
wolfSSL with support for all examples, use:

```
$ ./configure --enable-pkcs7 --enable-pwdbased --with-libz
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Build Examples

Running `make` will try to compile all C source files into their own
respective example application. Each source file can be compiled separately
if desired, for example:

```
make
gcc -o pkcs7 pkcs7.c -Wall -I/usr/local/include -Os -L/usr/local/lib -lm -lwolfssl
gcc -o ecc-verify ecc-verify.c -Wall -I/usr/local/include -Os -L/usr/local/lib -lm -lwolfssl
```

Some of the examples which use the CompressedData content type require the
zlib library to be installed. The default Makefile has the linking against
(-lz) commented out. Before making the CompressedData example, please
uncomment the following line in Makefile:

```
#ZLIB    += -lz
```

### Debugging

To enable debug messages change the Makefile to:

```
CFLAGS+=$(DEBUG_FLAGS)
#CFLAGS+=$(OPTIMIZE)
```

Build and install wolfSSL using:

```
./configure --enable-pkcs7 --enable-debug
make
sudo make install
```

Most of the examples listed below output a DER-encoded version of the
PKCS#7/CMS bundle that was generated. These DER-encoded files can be used to
do further analysis, or debugging with external tools.  Two helpful tools
for doing this include the `openssl cms` application and the `dumpasn1` app.

Debugging with `dumpasn1` ([dumpasn1 source file](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/dumpasn1.c))

```
$ dumpasn1 encryptedData.der
 0  80: SEQUENCE {
 2   9:   OBJECT IDENTIFIER encryptedData (1 2 840 113549 1 7 6)
13  67:   [0] {
15  65:     SEQUENCE {
17   1:       INTEGER 0
20  60:       SEQUENCE {
22   9:         OBJECT IDENTIFIER data (1 2 840 113549 1 7 1)
33  29:         SEQUENCE {
35   9:           OBJECT IDENTIFIER aes256-CBC (2 16 840 1 101 3 4 1 42)
46  16:           OCTET STRING 08 83 47 90 5D 9F D6 AA DC 25 CE B2 87 9A 10 CF

      :         }
      :       }
      :     }
      :   }

0 warnings, 0 errors.
```

Debugging with `openssl cms`

```

additional debugging.

If wolfSSL has been configured and compiled with debug support, the bytes
of the bundle will be printed out to the terminal window.

```
./compressedData
Successfully encoded CompressedData bundle (compressedData.der)
```

This example creates a PKCS#7/CMS EnvelopedData bundle that includes a ORI
RecipientInfo type. It uses AES256-CBC as the encryption algorithm, and
specifies the enveloped content type as DATA. ORI is losely defined by the CMS
RFC and allows users to specify their own encoding/decoding algorithm for
the RecipientInfo. This example uses a simple bitwise complement operation
for the encryption operation. This is not recommended to be used in production
and is simply an example of how user callbacks may be registered and used with
the ORI type. After creating the bundle, it decodes the enveloped bundle and

### SignedData encapsulating Encrypted FirmwarePkgData

Example file: `signedData-EncryptedFirmwarePkgData.c`
Generated bundle files: `signedEncryptedFirmwarePkgData_noattrs.der`,
                        `signedEncryptedFirmwarePkgData_attrs.der`

This example creates two PKCS#7/CMS SignedData bundles, one with attributes and
one without them. It uses RSA with SHA256 as the the signature algorithm,
and specifies the signed content type as EncryptedData. The inner EncryptedData
content type encpasulates a FirmwarePkgData type. After creating the
bundles, the app decodes them and verifies the operation was successful.

The generated SignedData bundles are written out to a file for analysis and
additional debugging.

If wolfSSL has been configured and compiled with debug support, the bytes
of the bundle will be printed out to the terminal window.

```
./signedData-EncryptedFirmwarePkgData
Successfully encoded Signed Encrypted FirmwarePkgData (signedEncryptedFPD_noattrs.der)
Successfully extracted and verified bundle contents
Successfully encoded Signed Encrypted FirmwarePkgData (signedEncryptedFPD_attrs.der)
Successfully extracted and verified bundle contents
```

### SignedData encapsulating Compressed FirmwarePkgData

Example file: `signedData-CompressedFirmwarePkgData.c`
Generated bundle files: `signedCompressedFirmwarePkgData_noattrs.der`,
                        `signedCompressedFirmwarePkgData_attrs.der`

This example creates two PKCS#7/CMS SignedData bundles, one with attributes and
one without them. It uses RSA with SHA256 as the the signature algorithm,

Successfully extracted and verified bundle contents
```

### SignedData using CryptoDev Callback

Example file: `signedData-cryptodev.c`
Generated bundle files: `signedData_cryptodev_noattrs.der`,
                        `signedData_cryptodev_attrs.der`

This example creates a PKCS#7/CMS SignedData bundle using the wolfCrypt
CryptoDev callback. CryptoDev allows a user to register a callback to do
cryptographic operations outside of wolfCrypt proper. This can be useful
in order to take advantage of hardware-based cryptography instead of the
default software implementation.

It uses RSA with SHA256 as the signature algorithm, and specifies
the signed content type as DATA. After creating the bundle, the app decodes it
and verifies the operation was successful.

The generated SignedData bundles are written out to a file for analysis and
additional debugging.

If wolfSSL has been configured and compiled with debug support, the bytes
of the bundle will be printed out to the terminal window.

```
./signedData-cryptodev
Successfully encoded SignedData bundle (signedData_cryptodev_noattrs.der)
Successfully verified SignedData bundle.
Successfully encoded SignedData bundle (signedData_cryptodev_attrs.der)
Successfully verified SignedData bundle.
```

### SignedData with Detached Signature

Example file: `signedData-DetachedSignature.c`
Generated bundle files: `signedData_detached_noattrs.der`,
                        `signedData_detached_attrs.der`

This example creates a PKCS#7/CMS SignedData bundle that does not include
the EncapsulatedContent eContent. This is known as a detached signature, and
is useful when signing a large amount of data to decrease the size of the
CMS bundle. It uses RSA with SHA256 as the signature algorithm, and specifies
the signed content type as DATA. After creating the bundle, the app decodes it
and verifies the operation was successful.

The generated SignedData bundles are written out to a file for analysis and
additional debugging.

If wolfSSL has been configured and compiled with debug support, the bytes
of the bundle will be printed out to the terminal window.

```
./signedData-DetachedSignature
Successfully encoded SignedData bundle (signedData_detached_noattrs.der)
Successfully verified SignedData bundle.
Successfully encoded SignedData bundle (signedData_detached_attrs.der)
Successfully verified SignedData bundle.
```

### SignedData encapsulating Encrypted Compressed FirmwarePkgData

Example file: `signedData-EncryptedCompressedFirmwarePkgData.c`
Generated bundle files: `signedEncryptedCompressedFirmwarePkgData_noattrs.der`,
                        `signedEncryptedCompressedFirmwarePkgData_attrs.der`

This example creates two PKCS#7/CMS SignedData bundles, one with attributes and
one without them. It uses RSA with SHA256 as the the signature algorithm,
and specifies the signed content type as CompressedData. The inner
CompressedData content type encpasulates an EncryptedData type, which in turn
encapsulates a FirmwarePkgData type. After creating the bundles, the app
decodes them and verifies the operation was successful.

The generated SignedData bundles are written out to a file for analysis and
additional debugging.

If wolfSSL has been configured and compiled with debug support, the bytes
of the bundle will be printed out to the terminal window.

```
./signedData-EncryptedCommpressedFirmwarePkgData
Successfully encoded Signed Encrypted Compressed FirmwarePkgData (signedEncryptedCompressedFPD_noattrs.der)
Successfully extracted and verified bundle contents
Successfully encoded Signed Encrypted Compressed FirmwarePkgData (signedEncryptedCompressedFPD_attrs.der)
Successfully extracted and verified bundle contents
```
